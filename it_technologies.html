                            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                            <p>Cybersecurity is the management and maintenance of a systems protection from any threats and attacks that are unwanted and have malicious intent. The need for cybersecurity has exponentially grown over the recent decades in tandem with the growth of technology in terms of innovation and usage, this is evidently seen as “Forbes reports an average 26,000 incidents a day” (1) with incidents referring to cybercrime. In order to combat malicious attackers and threats a wide array of cybersecurity protocols and actions are emplaced in order to prevent such threats, these protective and preventative measures can be as simple as teaching people to log off after using their devices and to have secure passwords to complex measures that involve creating anti-virus programs and creating complex algorithms that code encryptions and decryptions for messages. Cybersecurity doesn’t necessarily have a single state-of-the-art technology that is a be all and end all for all threats as the malicious threats and attacks that are presented are very broad and different and so defensive measures are also broad and different, additionally, cybersecurity is in a constant arms race with cybercrime. A good example of this is anti-virus software whether it be built into your computer or a third-party program such as Norton where they are constantly updating due to the fact that there is new malware being created or new inventive trojan attacks being sent which then lead to improvement to anti-virus software being needed and continuing in an ever escalating cycle. Currently, there are a multitude of things that people can do in order to be cybersafe and prevent cybercrime from occurring. The easiest and most simplest way to keep safe is to have complex and secure passwords, not to share your details to untrusted sources and to keep away from insecure links whilst also keeping your antiviral software up to date. Cybersecurity has a bright and interesting future ahead as “Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning will increasingly and continuously influence the evolution of cybersecurity” (2) . through the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning security will become more autonomous and thus will be less likely to be breached due to human error, furthermore, the advancement of these vital technologies will also see the creation and development of systems being able to predict and calculate future threats and how to either avoid them or solve the outright. Despite the innovative and bright future of cybersecurity the adverse will also occur, cybercriminals will eventually evolve to find alternate methods of attack to circumnavigate the increased defences or even use future machine learning and artificial intelligence as a platform to create new means of malicious attacks and threats. Furthermore, the future of cybersecurity doesn’t only improve with the improvement of technology but also through the improvement of behavioural analysis. Understanding the behaviour of attackers once they get into a system can show patterns that malicious attackers will display allowing cybersecurity experts to differentiate and identify the attacker faster and more efficiently catching the criminal and preventing any more harm from being done. Additionally, behaviour analysis can also aid companies from identifying issues and problems within the staff's everyday behaviours that leave the system at risk from attacks and through the advancements of behavioural analysis techniques cyber experts are “able to identify those people and mitigate that risk by training them properly"(3). The future of cybersecurity is broad and exciting with new challenges to overcome with the aid of new techniques and technologies.<br><br>The impact of developing cybersecurity is an overall positive for humanity and society as a whole and on an individual level as improving cybersecurity would mean a diminishment in cybercrime which ”One report from PurpleSec showed that cyber incidents rose 600% during the pandemic” (1). Developing cybersecurity won’t necessarily change the way you live your life but rather will make your everyday internet life a more safe place to relieve stress and worry on people greatly benefiting the individual and society. Additionally, the improvement of cybersecurity will greatly benefit businesses as “The average cost of a data breach in 2021 was 4.24 Million, according to IBM data” (1), with the improvements business won’t have to spend millions to criminals however these improvements will have to occur soon as “Cybersecurity Ventures predicts cybercrime will cost $10,5 trillion annually by 2025” (1), the massive loss of profit and revenue will obviously negatively impact businesses and thus will affect the employees working for the said businesses as the possibility of peoples jobs being lost will increase due to a loss of money to pay for salaries if the development of cybersecurity is not undertaken. However, companies spend large amounts of money to prevent such occurrences and for improvements on cybersecurity as evident by “Statista reports $40.8 billion in IT security spent in 2019” and in doing so will mean a large amounts of job opportunities will be available with The “job market is expected to grow 33% between 2020 and 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.”<br><br>Currently cybersecurity is not in the centre stage of my life, however, cybersecurity plays a pivotal background role in my everyday activities. I regularly watch shows on Netflix or watch a video on Netflix  where my data and passwords to my Gmail and the respective youtube and Netflix accounts are held. Without cybersecurity my passwords, access to data, access to personnel services and my email would be easily accessible without my consent which would not be a positive thing. Furthermore, I like to regularly shop online, whether it’s to purchase a new Gi for Jiu jitsu or do order some Korean Fried Chicken  without cybersecurity systems emplaced in the websites I order such items such as a secure storage system that is encrypted then malicious users would be able to easily gain my credit card details and make purchases without my consent or knowledge leading to me incurring large amounts of financial liability. Cybersecurity also plays a pivotal role in my parents life, without the protective and preventive measures of cybersecurity information of patients health records kept on my parent clinic system would mean the patients health records could be deleted, edited or be used as ransom to which my parents business would be held liable for the damages incurred. Cybersecurity is an often overlooked part of our lives that we take for granted yet without it the ability to do tasks online or to maintain and operate businesses would not be possible without the immense risk of being attacked by users with malicious intent, so, cybersecurity is a pivotal technological requirement of which runs in the background and goes unnoticed.

                            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
                            <p>To first fully understand autonomous vehicles we must first understand the levels of automation in driving. In the J 3016 guidelines established by SAE (Society of automotive engineers), “a global association of more than 128,000 engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive and commercial-vehicle industries”(1), they have outlined 6 different levels of driving automation.
                                <br>As seen here.<br> <img src="assets/SAE.jpg"> <br>Autonomous driving has been thoroughly explored by SAE and presented in the form of levels, level 0 through to level 5 with each level showing an increase in features and different types of technology implemented, to create a fully automated vehicle, also known as level 5 driving automation which can “drive the vehicle under all conditions”(2).
                                The current state of the driving automation level is at 2(3), there is a bountiful amount of features that are there to support the driver in their control of the vehicle whilst still requiring the full attention of the driver to take effect. The development of autonomous driving is progressing steadily and is already showing signs of level 3 driving automation(3) such as the ability of cars to self drive themselves in traffic taking control of your steering, brakes, and acceleration.<br><br>Autonomous vehicles with the ability to perform level 3 driving automation may start showing signs of being on the road, cars such as tesla models are already being implemented autopilot with tesla stating that “Autopilot comes standard on every new Tesla”(4) showing that they are already making moves to approach level 3 driving automation but they are yet to confidently be road worthy. More data is required as well as more tests are needed to improve the technology that is required to make the ability for cars to automatically drive themselves on the road. As the current state of vehicle automation that Tesla is performing at as well as many other car companies that are starting to implement the notion of self-driving cars, it can be expected that level 3 driving automation can be achieved rather soon. With the development that we are seeing, further down the road we can expect that these automation driving tests will expand its views on cars and maybe even look to go into different types of vehicles such as trucks, vans, buses, motorcycles and maybe even planes.<br><br>The progress of autonomous vehicles is only possible through technologies designed for cars that have been built and improved on over the years. These technologies that were originally developed for car safety, such as “Lane Keeping Assist”(5), “Emergency Braking”(5) or “Blind Spot Detection”(5) contain technology that is and will be used to make self-driving cars possible. Each new technology implements features that assist the driver in steering, braking, accelerating and even decision making, features that are expected of in autonomous vehicles.
                                The technology of the past is making the capabilities of cars to fully self-drive themselves a possibility. So what is holding them back? Self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles are only possible with a good artificial intelligence(6) that is able to learn and solve real-world problems that are clearly very unpredictable at times. A self-driving software that has very little data will not be able to perform well(6) in many situations that require a less apparent approach, but a software with an AI that has millions of driving footages analysed will be able to react to situations that are complex and correctly act in regards to that specific situation. For self-driving cars, data is what truly completes them.
<br><br>The impact of autonomous vehicles has the potential to become revolutionary, the results of accomplishing the technology for vehicles to become fully automated can significantly invoke a positive outcome both economically and environmentally. Cars that are able to become self-driving will be able to bring about fewer traffic accidents and congestion, as well as achieve the ability to save energy through their driving efficiency.(7) Autonomous vehicles are able to bring a positive impact on the road but they are still vulnerable to causing negatives outcomes to fields such as employment and even cyber threats.(7) They are very prone to these cyber threats due to the fact that vehicles containing the technology to become automated will contain hardware and software that may be exploited. Employment on the other hand can cause even further damage as more and more drivers struggle to keep their jobs, this impact not only affects jobs such as taxi drivers and ubers, but also trucks, delivery drivers and more that require a driver to be seated. As such, all types of drivers are likely to become the most affected, but drivers that work for a living will feel a more impactful blow into their life. On the other hand people that don’t drive will also feel the influence that autonomous vehicles have, as they might be more inclined to use or buy services or products of self-driving vehicles. As more people buy into this, it will potentially harm urban transport. By 2050, it is estimated that the use of public transportation will fall by 18% and the use of walking or cycling will fall by 13%(8). The self-driving technology will cause a poor return on health benefits, and the diminishing use of public transportation is likely to cause problems for those that are dependent on it if it ever becomes deemed no longer necessary to support.<br><br>Autonomous vehicles, self-driving technology, can only ever be a positive experience for me. The impact that this has on me is beneficial to my daily life, as well as my family and friends. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve the life of many people as well as improve the structure of society and the way transportation will be done. The impact it has to become an efficient source of transporting passengers, packages, food and many more will simplify the way I live my everyday life. Self-driving cars have the ability to not only be efficient in transportation but to also cause me to become more efficient in time-management as having me drive 1 hour to my location can be replaced with me having 1 hour to complete work. It will become a time-efficient tool as well as an educational benefit to me.
<br><br>Self-driving vehicles will be able to provide a safer alternative to transportation for my family and the people around me. It is more likely to prevent putting them in situations that are likely to cause accidents. Elderly family members as well as disabled users will have an option of travelling longer distances without relying on others as the cars will be able to drive for them, providing them a convenient and reliable mode of transportation.
<br><br>Overall, the impact of autonomous vehicles will provide the people around me, including myself, with an improvement in our day to day life, as we can look forward to having a reliable way of getting around in our daily life. The technology of self driving cars will immensely benefit the way I live and travel.<br><br>

                            <h2>Small Computing Devices</h2><p>Computing devices are functional units that perform computations, including arithmetic operations and logic operations. They can consist of standalone units, or several connected units. They can also be devices that perform a specific set of functions (Editor, n.d.)) . The Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Makey Makeys are all examples of computing devices.<br><br>
                            The Raspberry Pi is basically a small computer. It includes a processor, memory, and graphics processor, all contained on a small board. They are low cost, and capable of doing everything a desktop computer can do (Raspberry Pi, 2013). Because of this, they are also known as a Single Board Computer (SBC) (maxEmbedded, 2013). Some notable projects based around the Raspberry Pi include the MagicMirror (Magicmirror.builders, 2016), and RadioGlobe (Pullen J, 2020). The Raspberry Pi has also enabled many people to explore computing and coding by providing hands-on experience to the user. Some alternatives of the Raspberry Pi include the UDOO BOLT - a higher performance board designed for higher end gaming (UDOO, 2021), and the ASUS Tinker Board - a SBC based on ARM CPUs (ASUS Australia, n.d.).<br><br>
                            The Arduino is similar to the Raspberry Pi in many ways, but it is much smaller in scale (Arduino, 2018). A Raspberry Pi is essentially a small computer, while the Arduino is a re-programmable chip. Both can be adapted to many purposes. Arduinos are inexpensive, small, and have a simple programming environment. Because it is self-contained on a single chip, they are also known as a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) (au.rs-online.com, n.d.). Some popular projects using the Arduino include a digital temperature sensor (Dimitrov, K. 2016), and a Bluetooth controlled car (Fernando, S. 2018). Arduinos are great for designing devices with singular purposes. Some alternative Microcontrollers include the Adafruit Gemma M0 - an incredibly small board designed for wearable electronics (Adafruit. n.d.), and the NodeMCU - designed for mobile devices and networking applications (www.elecrow.com, n.d.).<br><br>
                            Makey Makey is an invention kit designed to turn everyday objects into touch pads. They are an artistic way for people to be creative, inventive, and imaginative (Joylabz Official Makey Makey Store, 2022). Projects can range from creating a banana piano (Joylabz Official Makey Makey Store, n.d.), to interactive puppets (Burker, J. n.d.).<br><br>
                            These small computing devices get much more sophisticated and efficient as technology evolves, improving on things such as performance, storage, connectivity, and customisation. Alongside these improvements, these devices can become smaller, faster, and cheaper over time, as the hardware needed for them becomes more efficient (Tardi, 2021).<br><br>
                            Commonplace end-user products made from small computing technologies include mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and wearable tech. These products are constantly innovated upon, including concepts such as flexible screens, and modular components, all of which are possible due to the improvements of small computing devices.
                            As the size of the hardware becomes smaller and smaller, new products such as Neuralink will go into development. These types of products have the potential to help lives, in the case of Neuralink, the developers claim that it will be able to restore full body functionality (Kay, 2022).<br><br>
                            Devices such as these that are easy for beginners to use are great for giving practical computing and programming experience to those that are interested, potentially expanding the field and providing people with a way to easily utilise technology. With more people starting and finishing projects with them, the faster that it will grow and be innovated upon. With the growth of these technologies, more specialised end-user products could become available, not only for purchase, but for the users to create for themselves.<br><br>
                            These computing devices are ideal for assistive tasks, and could help with tech related processes, such as monitoring moisture levels for plants, or robotic arms that can move with much more precision than human hands. There are also products that provide virtual assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, that can take the place of small service roles such as a cashier. If these devices began to be adapted for larger companies and corporations, they could also create jobs for programmers and engineers specialised in their use. If companies such as Neuralink are successful in their objectives, they could potentially replace, and at the very least assist with, jobs that fail due to human error.<br><br>
                            Unfortunately, because of the rapid pace these devices grow and make older iterations redundant, it will create a large amount of electronic waste. If newer versions of the Raspberry Pi are faster, more efficient, cheaper, and smaller, there are practically no reasons to keep the older versions, especially if newer projects specifically require the newer hardware to run. Some hobbyists may be able to make niche case uses for them and will be able to reuse or refurbish them, but for the vast majority of users, the newer iterations will be the most beneficial. There are some initiatives in place for these devices to be reused and refurbished, but eventually they will end up in landfill, which can leave lasting events on the environment (The dark side of electronic waste recycling, 2019).<br><br>
                            With researching this topic, I have become interested in the usefulness and practicality of these devices and have thought of some projects that could be useful to me, especially with my hobbies. I am interested in using a Raspberry Pi to host a server for some of the programs I run on my computer, which can free up some resources to use for other things. I could also try building a wall display or MagicMirror somewhere in the house that displayed things that I frequently look at, like the weather, calendar events, and news feeds. These types of things are also an interest to many of my friends, and I'm sure that we could create a lot of useful things with these devices, especially when we get familiarised with them.<br><br>
                            Small computing devices have been incredibly useful in my day to day life, the functionality of a mobile phone alone is incredibly useful as it can give me access to a lot of information like public transport timetables, or notify me of things like emails. I also have a tablet which I use for note taking, it is very useful for some of my hobbies, as well as University, and it allows me to cut down on paper usage as I no longer buy things like notebooks. Wearable tech, especially those with wellness services like a smart watch, are incredibly useful as they make fitness tracking easy and actionable. I am excited to see new wearable tech in the future, especially those that have to do with vision such as Microsoft HoloLens.<br><br>
                            Overall, small computing devices are a great way to start your own technology projects, as they are incredibly versatile devices that are easy to learn and use. These devices are constantly being improved and the things an individual will be able to do with them will only get better and better.

                            <h2>Robotics</h2><p>In 2022, By the rapid development of science and technology, Robots are widely used in all walks of life. Robot It is widely used in manufacturing, logistics, medical industry, human life services, marine, aviation, aerospace and other fields, (Francois Schmitt 2018) it also plays a great role in automobile manufacturing and electronic manufacturing. Robot also relate to the AI, deep learning and programming. There is some of the key areas for the robot, what can be done and what can robot done in the future.</p>
                            <h3>Manufacturing:</h3><p>
                                As the go-to solution for agile order fulfilment, robotic smart parts-to-picking systems are spreading across a wide range of industries. (Zheng Wang 2021). Robots can not only move shelves but also screen raw materials or defective products to improve overall production efficiency. For example, in some industries such as the back cover of mobile phones, some processes will produce defective products, and some defective products are difficult to identify with the human eye. At this time, the robot plays a very good role in identification, and with the automated robotic arm, the defective products can be separated from the production line.<br><br>
                                Another example is some express industries. Robots can quickly identify the destination of each express and partition it, thereby speeding up the speed of express delivery. Take China as an example. There are many provinces in China, and there are 3,000 express packages to be sent every second. In this context, the automated express delivery industry can greatly improve express delivery efficiency and reduce repetitive manual workloads.<br><br>
                                Another key area is CNC machines. Programming allows the robot to operate according to specified information，this is very important in automating work. Robotic arms can reduce labour and make products more accurate. Precision is particularly important for CNC machine tools, and because of this, manual engraving has inherent weaknesses, making robots irreplaceable in this industry. Robots can produce large-scale and efficient production and ensure high precision. For example, the automobile industry and the mobile phone industry require high precision and high output.
                                <br><br>
                            Soon, the popularity of robots in the manufacturing industry can greatly reduce the efficiency of labor and increase the efficiency of products, and products can also be produced with higher precision and reduce losses. Robots can also make people safer to produce some dangerous products such as nuclear weapons, spacecraft, etc.<br><br></p>

                            <h3>Medical industry:</h3><p>
                            Robots also have a very important position in the medical industry. Robotics can play a key role in four areas in the fight against infectious diseases, including clinical care, logistics, reconnaissance, continuity of work, and maintenance of socioeconomic functions (Antonio Di Lallo 2021) Before the epidemic, robots have been widely used in hotels and restaurants, and they are mainly used for the transmission of food items. During the epidemic, such robots can efficiently deliver food items to quarantined people in quarantine hotels. The participation of robots can effectively reduce the spread of the epidemic in the quarantine hotel. It can almost eliminate face-to-face contact between people, thereby increasing the efficiency and accuracy of isolation and reducing the spread of the epidemic. The cooperation of robots and AI can also effectively screen fever groups from the crowd. Compared with expensive hotel robots, such robots are more common in the epidemic. They can sense fever crowds with the help of infrared cameras and AI algorithms and notify security personnel to isolate and check the fever crowd. It can screen high-traffic people more quickly and safely. These devices are often used in the gates of residential areas, office buildings, etc.<br><br>
                            Robots also play an important role in the field of surgery. Some operations require very high precision, such as brain surgery and neurosurgery, which require very high experience and techniques. Robots can complete operations with ultra-low errors, which can reduce the risk of surgery with lower cost. Allowing more people with relatively low incomes access to expensive and lower-risk surgeries.<br><br>
                            In the future, 5g technology, AI algorithms and robots can be added to the medical industry more widely, and the size of the robotic arm can be greatly reduced. People can undergo surgery in extreme outdoor conditions, or relatively low-cost surgery in poor areas.<br><br>
                            <h3>What is the robot's likely impact?</h3><p>
                            Regardless of any industry, the promotion of robots can improve efficiency and accuracy. For example, in the express industry, faster screening, sorting and delivery, higher efficiency and accuracy in the manufacturing industry, and safer and lower costs in the medical industry. Widespread use of robots could have a serious impact on employment rates, for example in the courier industry workers and drivers may be replaced, Because the robot can be responsible for tasks such as delivery of express, classified express, etc. And the robot has higher precision and lower cost of use. Workers in the production line may also be replaced by robots, because robots have lower investment, can produce products efficiently and accurately, and can even work 24 hours a day, These are things that ordinary workers cannot do. Although it is difficult for robots to threaten some jobs with high technical requirements, such as doctors and nurses, most of the jobs can be replaced by robots now or in the future. If this happens, it will greatly affect the people. income, unemployment, etc.<br><br>
                            Some industries cannot be done by workers, such as some high-risk jobs, or industries such as digital machine tools that are mass-produced and require high precision, The existence of robots in these aspects not only brings convenience to human beings, but also makes some impossible things possible. For example, the participation of robots in the automotive industry allows people to use safer and more reliable vehicles, reducing consumption in production. In deep-sea operations and high-temperature nuclear waste processing, the participation of robots also keeps people away from danger.</p>
                            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3><p>
                                But on the bright side, the existence of robots can indeed provide convenience for humans. For me, the existence of robots can have many benefits. It has become impossible to eliminate the epidemic at the moment of the impact of the epidemic. However, robots can not only better screen people with fever and make our society safer, but also can effectively reduce the spread of the epidemic. Some traditional industries can be carried out in a non-face-to-face form, such as fully automatic food delivery, etc. As an IT practitioner, I can also expand my employment direction. Programming will become more and more important, and the demand for such jobs will also increase, such as AI intelligence and deep learning. For the elders at home, the existence of the robot provides great convenience. It can not only provide more medical insurance, but also make the travel of the elders more convenient. I believe that with the popularisation of autonomous driving, roads will become safer in the longer term, and AI-controlled cars can also provide more protection for pedestrians and reduce the accident rate when walking at night. I believe that in the longer future, with the popularisation of automatic driving, the travel of the elderly and the disabled will also be more convenient and the roads will become safer. AI-controlled cars can also provide more protection for pedestrians when walking at night.<br>
