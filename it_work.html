                            <h3>Day in the life of a Cyber Security Analyst</h3>
                            <p>A cybersecurity analyst “is a professional that is trained to detect and prevent attacks to their organisation or network.” (1) A security analyst reviews a company’s day to day operations and analysis any breaches or threats that may present themselves to companies and finds ways to prevent the threat and stop them from ever emerging. In order to complete such tasks as stated by Josh Madakor “We would kind of create an initial draft” (5:56) of the action plan via software and tools such as Azure. Once a draft is made an analyst would then “iterate on that draft” (6:56) until a final product was made and then present the final product to the team manager who would then present the project to the clients for approval. When working as a cybersecurity analyst “you will work and communicate with many members, not just IT and security” (1). When formulating drafts for action plans or investigating breaches as a security analyst you will be interviewing and working with other employees of the company such as “people in accounting, marketing or HR” (1) in order to get better information to either draft a plan that is targeted for those particular employees or to investigate where a breech came from and understand the activities that other employees do on a day to day basis that leads to the possibility of attacks and breaches. Overall, as a CSA you will be working with a wide variety of people that both understand the computer side of things and those who are not proficient in computer activities and thus you must be flexible and patient in order to be a good CSA. Typically, a CSA would “work in an office, during the traditional work hours of 9.00 am and 5.00 pm” (3) however, due to breaches and threats occurring anytime an analyst is expected to be ready to get back to work at any time. Even though an analyst spends most of their time in the office on a unique project or if working as a “consultant, this job likely requires travel to different locations around the country” (3) and even internationally. As a CSA every day is a challenging day where new challenges are presented whether they are creating new project drafts to fight breaches and attacks or investigating attacks and threats that have occurred.</p>

                            <h3>The life of a web developer</h3>
                            <p>The work of a web developer includes so much more than just designing a website. Web developers design, create, and maintain their websites, while also creating updates and debugging their website. Web developers work with a wide variety of languages such as jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, SAS, CSS, PHP and mySQL, therefore having the capability to work both backend and frontend coding.
                                Working as a web developer involves solving coding problems and attending meetings. A web developer will spend most of their working hours at their desk working and coding for their company or client but will occasionally also attend meetings that debrief them on their progress and expectations, held by an individual in a leading position, or their boss. These web developers will also be allocated a time to go on breaks, where they can spend their time relaxing, playing sports/video games, eating and hanging out with their co-workers. While most of their work ends up being repetitive and easy to perform, it is likely that they will also struggle on their codes from time to time as they get allocated complicated problems to solve, spending the majority of their working hours solving and figuring out solutions rather than physically inputting codes.
                                Web developers will over the course of their career run into many problems with their codes taking them hours or even days to solve, creating a challenge in completing it before a certain deadline. Not only does the ability to solve these challenging problems cause difficulties. The feeling of burning out and losing their motivation to continue on their work or project causes a challenging mentality to continue on their work.
                                Web developers have a wide variety of skills that they must use to complete their work. They spend time working and coding from their office desk and attending meetings both in-person and online. They spend a lot of time thinking up solutions to their codes creating a challenge mentally for them to overcome. Web development can be a fun and relaxing job but expect there to be times where codes get hard and continuing on can become overbearing.

                            <h3>The life of a Data analysis. </h3><p>From the youtube video by the IT professional, both of them are working as data analysts, Data analysis is the job that dealing with customers’ data, and transforming them into a more visible useable database. Stefanovic and Jennifer, are working on data dashboard updating or debugging, putting data from Excel into the database. Investigating data in SQL, creating reports for them.

                            Most of the time they are interacting with other teams, stakeholders, and clients. Stefanovic interacts with the stakeholders for new requirements for the existing dashboard or regrading the dashboards. Jennifer always has meetings with cross-functional teams with their project to test the project. Because the database needs debugging and testing for any issues and requirements.

                            Most of the time they spend on their job is for the data. Stefanovic spends a lot of time debugging the existing and new dashboard, adding features to the existing dashboard, and designing a new dashboard for the clients by their requirements. Jennifer spends lots of the time on data transformation, SQL queries, databases,s, and reports.

                            Most of the challenging parts of their job are data transformation. For the data analyst, they need to transform the data from excel to the database. Normally data is not being moded yet for the database and the data analysts cannot put the data directly in the database. Data analysts need to understand the data, design the database for those data and then transfer the data into the database. They also need to set up the SQL queries pends on the requirement of the clients.

                            <h3>Day in the life of a Software Engineer
                            </h3><p></p>A software engineer “creates web applications, mobile apps, robots, operating systems and network systems” (1) or basically “anyone that touches code and programs things for your computer” (0:29) . In a more technical note, a software engineer could create a website such as homejoy where the “Backend systems are in python and all our front-end stuff is in HTML, Javascript and CSS” (0:46). Additionally, “Software engineers also spend time revising and rewriting other people’s code as needed” (1) and whilst coding does constitute the majority of the work other key work is also required such as brainstorming ways to solve a challenge and also documenting code and the thought process behind it. Whilst completing their projects and tasks a software engineer will regularly work with clients as “building prototypes for clients is another common task”. Furthermore, software engineers will regularly work within a team that not only has other software engineers but depending on the project and task will often “collaborate with project managers, UI or UX designers, data scientists” (1) and other IT professionals in order to produce the best possible product that meets the needs and wants demanded by a client. Software engineers typically spend their days coding and thus will either work from home or work in an office environment, however, “Software engineers may attend meetings interspersed throughout the day” (1) with the afternoon night spent “checking in with colleagues on shared projects” (1) with the workday typically being from 9-6. This doesn’t apply to every software engineer though as some engineers may fly across the country or even internationally to meet new clients and work different systems for different companies. Due to the nature of software engineering, which is to create code in order to meet the needs and wants demanded by a client, a software engineer will be facing new issues and challenges each day. A client’s demand will never be the same so a software engineer must always be thinking of and brainstorming ideas and ways to solve the issue at hand and then code the solution. Once coding is completed the list of challenges does not end there, the engineer must then solve any bugs and make sure the objective of the project is met and satisfies the client.

                            <h3>Day in the life of a Game designer
                            </h3><p></p>In my view, one of the world’s most profitable jobs is game designer. And this is belongs to one of the IT subjects, also one of my friends is study game design in our school.
                            What game designers need to do are as same as the other commuters, woke up at 8 or 9 in the morning then have a shower. Take almost 20 to 60 minutes to company, after arrived in the company, took their breakfast and finished them. Later they will checked their e-mail then doing their works, took them like 3 or 4 hours to do their tasks after they took first break. At the time when they were having relax, they can enjoy their lunch, have a lunch break, playing video games, chat with others and so on.
                            After the break, the workers all need to go back to their work, different things need to do different jobs, include game director, game develop and so on. Our game designers need to do many stuffs, we need to design the game’s logic system, then separate into different parts. 	What we need to do is to follow the system we design and write codes for each parts. Therefore, we will continue to write codes for this game, and each new game’s development cycle is around 3 to 5 years, but there may be some accidents, like out of funds, lack of people or, take too long to make this.
                            After the lunch break and work for a couple of hours, we might have a conversation with other doukis, talk about the game jobs or something important. Ending of one day’s 8 hours hard work, if we don’t have to do overtime jobs, we’ll just get off work and go home to have rest, otherwise we can decide to hang out and have fun with our friends. This, is the one day of a game designer
