Hi, my name is Haosheng (Alvin) Huang. I was born October 2003, currently 18 and originally from China however I moved to Australia at the age of 4. 
Since I moved to Australia at an early age I am not as fluent in Mandarin, but my Cantonese is slightly stronger, and I can read, write and converse better in “canto.” 
I often did go to Chinese school on the weekends to build my Chinese, but it did not work as well as I hoped, considering my Mandarin is still inadequate. 
I’m currently aiming to hit top 500 on valorant where it is my main game that i play. 
I played a lot of basketball throughout my schooling days for about 4 years where I recently stopped due to the pandemic situation. 
The only pet I ever owned was a rabbit called bun where the hardest part about owning a pet is to clean up their mess. 
I am currently a student at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) studying IT (Information Technology).
