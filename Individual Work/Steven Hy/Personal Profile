My name is Steven Hy and my ethnicity is Chinese. Despite being Chinese I grew up 
surrounded by Vietnamese culture as both my parents are Chinese but lived and grew up in 
Vietnam. At home I speak Cantonese. Currently I am both studying and aiming to complete a 
degree in the Bachelor of IT which I hope can assist me in getting a job. Outside of work and
university I like to spend my leisure time playing games such as valorant or any new upcoming 
titles that interest me. Apart from playing video games I enjoy organising time to spend with my 
mates, going out for lunch or dinner.
