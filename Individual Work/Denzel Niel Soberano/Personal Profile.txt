I was born in the Philippines and in 2003, our family moved to Australia as dad had many job opportunities as an aircraft mechanic. In my free time I enjoy reading - mostly fantasy and sci-fi but I am also a sucker for horror stories, I also play video games - some competitive games such as Valorant but mostly action-adventure games like Dark Souls. My interest in IT comes from building and fixing computer systems when I was younger.
