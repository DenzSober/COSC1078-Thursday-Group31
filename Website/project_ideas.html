                            <h3>Overview</h3><p>Everything that we do leaves a lasting impact on earth, this application aims to provide users information about their own impact, and provide tips, alternatives, and practical steps to reduce it. The user would input information that influences their carbon footprint, such as their usage of electricity and water. After they have input their information, the app will show them the potential impacts on the environment of their actions and then provide actions or alternatives that will help reduce their carbon footprint. There are some easy ways to reduce your carbon footprint such as taking shorter showers, or utilising public transport over your car, but there are many other ways that may not be as obvious, such as where your groceries come from. This app will aim to quickly show these alternatives to the user.
                        </p>
                            <h3>Motivation</h3><p>Global warming has been a topic of conversation for quite a long time, and to this day, is still a highly debated subject. Despite these debates, there is no denying the negative impact that humans have on the environment. This app is for those that are conscious of their environmental impact, and wish to make a change, but don't necessarily know how to accomplish that. There are services already in use, such as https://carbonpositiveaustralia.org.au/, but this project differs in that it aims to give users much more information and alternatives
                        </p>
                            <h3>Description</h3><p>The application will require the user to input information about their past month, in order to calculate their carbon footprint as accurately as possible. This information will consist of: water usage, energy usage, travel and transport, food and drink, and waste. Once this information has been entered, the application will report to the user on how each category contributes to their carbon footprint and give them a score based on the projected carbon emissions that an individual should be at. In order to help users properly understand their impact on the environment, the report will also show things such as how much natural habitats would need to be restored to offset their emissions, or how many earths would be needed to properly sustain the population if everybody lived the same way. The report will go into detail of which categories contribute the most of their emissions, showing the user which ones they may want to prioritise on. The application will then begin to show users how to offset their emissions, starting with general tips that help with everything. These tips will come from sources such as the UN (Nations, 2021), and will include things such as switching to energy efficient light bulbs, taking shorter showers, using reusable items, etc. These tips and actions will gradually get more specific to the user, evaluating things such as alternative electricity companies, environmentally friendly groceries, and comparing the fuel economy of their next vehicle purchases. Some of these solutions, such as installing solar panels may also help save the user some money in the long run on top of helping lower their carbon footprint. The user may also indicate some things that are non-negotiable, for example, they may not have any public transport options to get to work so they must use their car, the application will take these things into account and provide alternative ways in other categories to offset those emissions.<br><br>

                            The application can also direct users to environmental projects happening around them if they wish to further offset their carbon emissions. If there was for example, a group asking for volunteers to clear litter in an area, or if there were any companies or organisations that focus on sustainability that they could donate to. These actions would also be taken account when calculating a users score and when providing alternative ways to offset their carbon emissions.<br><br>

                            We could even partner with environmentally focused companies to provide users with the proper information that could be missed in terms of sustainability. For example, rubbish collection companies can provide ways to properly recycle items without contaminating them, or a cooking application that will show the users how to make the most out of the ingredients they use.<br><br>

                            The application will also have an optional 'daily' mode, that will allow users to track their day to day activities. The purposes of this will be to provide much more in depth personal insights and more specific ways to help them reduce their carbon footprint. By using this mode, they may find out, for example, that their energy usage is highest on a particular day and the application can help with reducing it. However, tracking this information may be difficult if it is not readily available, in order to create a good estimate the application could simply do things such as track how long the user uses their car. These estimates can also be extrapolated from their monthly data in order to be more accurate.<br><br>

                        </p>
                            <h3>Tools + Tech</h3><p>Tools and Tech we will use for this app will be Database Java, GPS, also others like apple health. We will use java for creating the app, and we mainly focus on the mobile app that can allow the customer to calculate the carbon footprint they are creating in real-time. We will make some shortcuts in the home screen to let customers record their daily actions. For example, how many drinks of water do you drink today? How did you travel to and from school or work? What food did you eat for the day? The app will record that information to the online database. the server will calculate the footprint in real-time and show it to the customers. GPS and apple health will record the customer's route for that day and how many steps they have for the day. We will also make some rewards to encourage users to reduce their carbon footprint, then lower the pollution overall.<br><br>

                        </p>
                            <h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills required for this app will be, java programming skills, skills in database, SQL, and skills in IOS and android. This app needs skills in app creation, the programmer will need to face the user interface design and the programming of the app, and also need to upload the information to the online database. Server skills for maintaining the customers’ data and calculating the customers’ carbon footprint, avoiding server attacks also keep the customers’ data safe. App also needs the skills of requiring the information from the customer's mobile phone, like the footsteps from apple health. Overall those are the skills required for creating the app we plan for.<br><br>
                        </p>
                            <h3>Outcome</h3><p>By providing users with tips, alternatives, and solutions they can do to lower their carbon footprint, hopefully people will take their environmental impact seriously. If more people actively tried to lower their carbon emissions, it could inspire other people to do the same, and eventually get bigger companies and corporations to do the same. With these improvements, the Earth could be around for a whole lot longer than what is currently being projected.</p><br><br>
